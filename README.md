######Collision in 2-dimension


###This program is made using Basic Concepts of Physics:-
#In this everytime when the distance between the balls becomes less than or equal to the sum of their radius the program declares it as a collision.
#Now it performs basic calculation by finding the vector along x and vector along y of the balls and change them
##This is the how this program is working
